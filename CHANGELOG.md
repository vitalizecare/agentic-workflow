## [Unreleased] - 2026-09-28 — Provider-agnostic toolkit

The toolkit now supports Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor equally, with one canonical core and a thin adapter per provider.

### Added

- `setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor`: installs for the listed providers. With no flag, it installs for every provider CLI it detects. Provider-specific logic lives in `providers/<name>/install.sh` and `providers/<name>/install-hooks.sh`.
- `~/.agentic-workflow/toolkit`: stable symlink to the repo. Skills now resolve shared fragments through `SHARED_DIR=~/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared` instead of their own provider-specific symlink.
- `~/.agentic-workflow/providers`: registry of installed providers (`<name> <skills-dir>` per line).
- `skills/_shared/capabilities.md`: provider-neutral capability vocabulary (**Ask the user**, **Spawn a subagent**, **Dispatch in parallel**, **Invoke skill**, `mcp: server/tool`, …) mapped to each provider's tools.
- `planning/PROVIDERS.md`: provider reference (CLIs, config paths, skills dirs, hook systems, MCP registration, transcript locations) and the canonical-vs-emitted layout.
- Hook adapters `config/hooks/adapters/codex.sh` and `config/hooks/adapters/cursor.sh`. They translate each provider's hook input and exit codes to the canonical protocol that `config/hooks/*.sh` already speaks, so the safety logic exists once.
- MCP servers are registered with all three providers (Cursor via `~/.cursor/mcp.json`).
- Canonical repo instructions: `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/rules/`. `.agents/rules/` is the only copy of each rule. `scripts/sync-rules.sh` symlinks `.claude/rules` and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` to it and regenerates a Rules Index table in `AGENTS.md`.
- Judge: `codex-cli` and `cursor-cli` model providers alongside `claude-cli`.
- Scorer: pluggable transcript sources for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, selected with `--provider`.

### Changed

- All skills now name capabilities instead of Claude Code tool names. `allowed-tools` frontmatter is still read by Claude Code, and the other providers ignore it. Skills are invoked as `/<name>` in Claude Code and Cursor, and as `$<name>` in Codex.
- Skills are symlinked into each installed provider's skills directory, not just `~/.claude/skills/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is now a symlink to `AGENTS.md`. `/bootstrap` generates `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/` in target repos, and links them for each provider.
- SKILL.md files no longer embed the preamble. They reference `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md`, and design skills also reference `_design-preamble.md`.
- README, `planning/` docs, and package descriptions were rewritten for the new name and provider-neutral wording. The statusline, shell integration, and plugin marketplaces are documented as Claude Code only.

### Fixed

- `prism-mcp` never started. prism-mcp-server 5.1.0 only boots when `argv[1]` ends in `server.js`, and `npx` launches it through a `.bin` symlink, so it exited 0 silently. `setup.sh` now installs `prism-mcp-server@5.1.0` globally and registers `node <npm root -g>/prism-mcp-server/dist/server.js`.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-27

### Removed

- Memory layer fully removed from agentic-bridge: 6 memory MCP tools (`search_memory`, `traverse_memory`, `get_context`, `create_memory_link`, `create_memory_node`, `ingest_conversation`), memory DB (nodes, edges, embeddings, traversal_logs tables), ingestion pipeline (embedding service, async queue, secret filter, session queue, transcript parser, Claude Code watcher/parser), EventBus, SSE route, and all associated REST endpoints (`/memory/*`, `/events`). Memory and knowledge-graph functionality delegated to prism-mcp.
- Next.js 15 UI dashboard (`ui/`) fully removed — visualization delegated to prism Mind Palace.
- `start.sh` removed (previously started bridge + UI together).
- `config/hooks/bridge-context.sh` SessionStart hook removed — prism-mcp handles session context via its own hook.
- 242 bridge tests removed (memory, ingestion, and UI layer); 25 test files deleted.
- `@huggingface/transformers` and `sqlite-vec` removed from bridge dependencies.

### Added

- `setup.sh`: Registers `prism-mcp` MCP server (`prism-mcp-server@5.1.0`) with Claude Code and Codex via `npx -y`. Skips registration if already registered. Final summary updated to show `agentic-bridge, prism-mcp`.
- `.claude/rules/mcp-servers.md`: Added `prism-mcp` row to the MCP server table.

### Changed

- `mcp-bridge` stripped to 5 coordination MCP tools only: `send_context`, `get_messages`, `get_unread`, `assign_task`, `report_status`. No UI. No memory DB. No embedding model.
- `setup.sh` now removes legacy `bridge-context.sh` SessionStart hook if present (cleanup for existing installations).
- Test baseline: 99 bridge tests (down from 341); 0 UI tests (down from 67). 100% coverage maintained.

---

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- `config/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh`: New PreToolUse hook (4th in Bash chain) that rewrites eligible commands (`git status/log/diff/push/show`, `vitest run`, `npm test`, `npm run test`, `tsc`, `npx tsc`, `eslint`, `npx eslint`, `cargo test/build`, `next build`) to `rtk` equivalents for 60-90% token savings on command output. Silent passthrough if rtk is not installed.
- `config/hooks/bridge-context.sh`: New SessionStart hook that derives the repo slug, queries the agentic-bridge `/memory/context` endpoint, and prints recent decisions/topics/tasks at session open. Silent no-op when bridge is unreachable.
- `setup.sh`: Added `=== Installing rtk ===` section (Homebrew on macOS, install script on Linux, fatal on failure), `=== Installing headroom ===` section (`pip3 install headroom-ai[all]`, fatal on failure), headroom MCP registration with Claude Code and Codex, `rtk-rewrite.sh` added as 4th entry in the Bash hook chain, `bridge-context.sh` SessionStart hook registration.
- `.claude/rules/hooks.md`: Added `rtk-rewrite.sh` and `bridge-context.sh` rows and hook ordering note.
- `.claude/rules/mcp-servers.md`: Added `headroom` row to the MCP server table.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/rtk-headroom-bridge-context-integration.md`: Design spec documenting the integration architecture for rtk, headroom, and bridge-context.

### Changed

- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`: Updated taglines, prerequisites, and setup description to reflect rtk, headroom, and bridge-context additions.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- 12 new platform-specific sub-skills: `verify-web`, `verify-ios`, `design-analyze-web`, `design-analyze-ios`, `design-evolve-web`, `design-evolve-ios`, `design-mockup-web`, `design-mockup-ios`, `design-implement-web`, `design-implement-ios`, `design-verify-web`, `design-verify-ios`
- Generic `skills/_shared/skill-lock.sh` for mutual exclusion across concurrent simulator and browser sessions; used by `verify-ios` and `verify-web`
- Platform dispatcher pattern: `verify-app`, `design-analyze`, `design-evolve`, `design-mockup`, `design-implement`, and `design-verify` detect the target platform and delegate to the appropriate sub-skill
- `MANAGED_SKILLS` in `setup.sh` expanded from 22 to 34 entries covering all new sub-skills
- `xcodebuildmcp` (pinned at `xcodebuildmcp@2.3.0`) registered as MCP server for iOS Simulator control (build, launch, `snapshot_ui`, screenshot, tap, swipe)
- Design pipeline updated in `.claude/rules/design.md` to reflect `[web|ios]` argument variants
- `mcp-servers.md` rule updated with `xcodebuildmcp` usage guidance and a "When to use XcodeBuildMCP" quick-reference table

### Changed

- 6 existing skills (`verify-app`, `design-analyze`, `design-evolve`, `design-mockup`, `design-implement`, `design-verify`) rewritten as thin platform dispatchers — all execution logic moved to platform-specific sub-skills
- `verify-web` is the new home for `browser-lock.sh` (previously in `verify-app`); `verify-app` no longer carries browser-locking logic
- `mobai` MCP server replaced by `xcodebuildmcp` for iOS Simulator automation
- Preamble table in `skills/_preamble.md` updated to list all 34 skills; change propagated to all 16 existing `SKILL.md` files
- `skills/_design-preamble.md` updated to reflect the dispatcher pattern for design sub-skills
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.claude/worktrees/` directory

### Fixed

- TOCTOU race in `skill-lock.sh` `acquire_lock` — replaced non-atomic test-then-create with an atomic `O_EXCL` open pattern
- `LOCK_NAME` input validation in `skill-lock.sh` to reject path traversal characters (e.g. `../`)
- `xcodebuildmcp` pinned to `xcodebuildmcp@2.3.0` (previously `@latest`) to eliminate supply-chain risk from unreviewed upstream updates
- Argument hints corrected in dispatcher `SKILL.md` frontmatter to show `[web|ios]` syntax
- Simulator lock acquisition hardened with error handling for edge cases in `skill-lock.sh`

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- `config/hooks/` directory with four shell hooks: `block-destructive.sh`, `block-push-main.sh`, `detect-secrets.sh`, and `git-context.sh`
- `config/settings.json` updated with consolidated PreToolUse (Bash matcher) and SessionStart hook registrations
- `.claude/rules/hooks.md` documenting PreToolUse vs SessionStart protocols, hook file inventory, and steps for adding new hooks
- `setup.sh` installs hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/` using an idempotent replace strategy (copy, not symlink)

### Fixed

- Bearer token charset and `printf` portability corrected in hook scripts
- `setup.sh` hook installation uses idempotent replace strategy instead of append, preventing duplicate entries on re-runs
- Comments added to `setup.sh` explaining `set -e` omission rationale and non-git cwd behaviour

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Glob-scoped rule files in `.claude/rules/` replacing the monolithic `CLAUDE.md` (rules: `bridge-services.md`, `bridge-transport.md`, `database.md`, `design.md`, `ingestion.md`, `mcp-servers.md`, `skills.md`, `testing.md`, `ui.md`)
- Dockerized Serena LSP integration (`Dockerfile.serena`, `Dockerfile.serena-csharp`, `scripts/serena-docker` wrapper)
- Per-repo Serena config (`.serena/project.yml`) with TypeScript language settings and sensitive path exclusions
- Bootstrap skill Step 7: auto-generates `.serena/project.yml` with language detection
- `setup.sh` builds Serena Docker images, installs wrapper script, and registers MCP server globally
- `.claude/settings.json` with `disableBypassPermissionsMode` to prevent unsafe permissions bypass
- `.dockerignore` for Docker builds
- `.gitignore` entries for Serena runtime data, `settings.local.json`, and `coverage/`
- Adaptive statusline (`statusline.sh`) with context-first layout and five width tiers: FULL (>=116), MEDIUM (>=101), NARROW (>=78), COMPACT (>=65), COMPACT-S (<65)
- Separate Usage (5h/7d rate limits) and Context columns in the statusline display
- Mid-session terminal resize detection via hooks registered in `settings.json` (`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`Stop`)
- Statusline installation integrated into `setup.sh`
- `statusLine` config block added to `settings.json`

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` trimmed to under 80 lines — now a navigation document with a pointer to `.claude/rules/`; skill count and add-skill steps corrected
- Updated bootstrap skill (`bootstrap/SKILL.md`) to generate `.claude/rules/` directories and route `RULES_OK` audits correctly; hardened `RULES_OK` check to require non-empty `.claude/rules/` directory
- Replaced stale `@xenova/transformers` package reference with `@huggingface/transformers` across documentation
- Removed MCP server table from all skill preambles (centralized in `.claude/rules/mcp-servers.md`)
- Removed all `/* v8 ignore */` annotations from source files — coverage must be earned through real tests
- Dropped 100% coverage threshold enforcement from vitest.config.ts in both packages
- Updated TESTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and CLAUDE.md to document prohibition on v8 ignore annotations

### Fixed

- Corrected inaccurate rule file content found during multiple review passes
- `project_name` field and bootstrap Step 7 clarifications in `.serena/project.yml`
- Docker infrastructure: opt-in C# build, removed port exposure, granular volume mounts, `--pull` flag, `.dockerignore`
- Documented `dotnet-install.sh` trust model and version pinning rationale
- Added COMPACT-S tier for terminals narrower than 65 columns to prevent field overflow
- Added 50 ms sleep in `statusline.sh` before reading terminal width to resolve SIGWINCH race condition
- Added 50 ms sleep after SIGWINCH in the Stop hook to close the resize race
- Reliable terminal width resolution via shell integration file (avoids `tput` subshell returning 80)
- Aligned Context header label with data column width across all tiers
- Reverted tput-first approach; `$COLUMNS` is now the primary width source
- Shell PID written out for hook-based resize signaling
- Replaced double-wide Unicode `↺` with a plain space in usage reset format to prevent rendering issues
- Widened field formats to prevent overflow; cache field preserved through the NARROW tier
- `jq` is now a hard prerequisite with an abort message and install instructions if missing
- API wait field shows `--` when the field is absent from the JSON payload
- Quoted numeric `jq` fields to prevent eval injection; removed Rate label from fallback path
- `setup.sh` merges hooks additively into existing `settings.json` rather than replacing; skips writing `shell-integration.sh` when the file is already identical
- `setup.sh` initializes `terminal_width` via `stty size </dev/tty` instead of relying on `$COLUMNS` (which is unset in the installer subshell)
- `setup.sh` guards the `statusLine` key with `jq has("statusLine")` and uses `grep -qF` for exact source-line matching
- `config/statusline.sh` type-guards `resets_at` timestamps: applies `floor | tostring` only when the value is a JSON number, passes strings through as-is
- `config/statusline.sh` removes `tput cols` from the width fallback; `COLS` now derives from `${COLUMNS:-}` only (tput is unreliable in Claude Code subprocesses)
